# Note Taker Starter Code

## Description
This application is designed to have a fully functioning web application and use it as a place to write and save notes.

## User Story
As a small business owner I want to be able to write and save notes to organise my thoughts and track tasks I need to complete.

## Installation
When running locally please install into the terminal "npm install" to begin.

## Issues
As of right now, I have been able to generate the route for the new notes and the write file is appearing in the "db.json" file. However, when running it on the local host through the web browswer the data is not showing up.
